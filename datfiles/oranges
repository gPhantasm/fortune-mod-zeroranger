%
If you die during the simulation, things get a bit easier.

%
Be warned though. As you cling on to this cycle, your desires poison your mind.
%
Ignorance.
Attachment.
Aversion.
%
Feeding these unwholesome thoughts will only lead to more suffering.
%
Things aren't going to get any easier.
But I know you can make it.
%
Don't give up.
%
The end
%
Earned a continue!!
%
Max continues!!
%
You had it rough, didn't you?
%
Simulation all over. It's time for green orange. You may now enter the 2nd loop.
%
You're on your own now. Good luck.
%
I saw what you did, though.
%
Do you really believe you can resolve things this way?
%
Hmph.
%
THE UNKNOWN ALIEN VESSEL,
CODENAME "GREEN ORANGE"
IS APPROACHING AS WE SPEAK.
%
THIS IS A TRAINING SIMULATION
CREATED FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE.
%
PLEASE NOTE THAT ALTHOUGH THIS
SIMULATION IS EXTREMELY
ACCURATE TO REAL LIFE,

THE EXPERIENCE MIGHT DIFFER
IN THE FINAL ENCOUNTER.

FOR ONE,
YOU COULD ACTUALLY DIE.
%
BEGIN THE SIMULATION
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

GOOD LUCK.
%
Hm, it crashed again?
This is getting troublesome...
%
We never expected you to pass our training program. Well done.
%
It's all thanks to Erasure.
%
...Well, to be completely honest, we didn't build it from scratch. We used this strange stone-like core as its base.
%
Hmm? That sounds awfully convenient to you? Are you perhaps implying we're simply pawns to Erasure?
%
Go get some rest or something. Meeting dismissed.
%
100% correct?
%
...Really now?
%
If you really insist.
%
Language, please.
%
Use more imagination.
%
You got me.
%
But didn't you...?
%
MOI OON EERO
%
Why so XXXX?
%
Our main fighter,
codename Type-A "Grapefruit",
spearheaded a counter-attack
at the space elevator.
%
Soon after,
all communication with
â€œGrapefruit" was lost.
%
Our chances of survival:
Slim to none.
%
Would you wish to surrender?
YES / NO
%
...Well.

I did not quite expect that.

I figured confronting you
like that would've awakened
some fighting spirit in you.

But it seems you've already
lost all hope.

Or maybe you're just not
taking me very seriously.
For asking such silly
questions, i mean.
%
...I wonder what made you feel that way.
%
...You seem hesitant somehow.

But given the odds
that's more than expected.

Good luck.

You'll need it.

Proper battle data can't be gathered if the starting point of the simulation has been artificially altered.
%
You didn't skip anything, now did you?
%
Next time, try clearing the training program from the very start.
%
Wow... You almost had it, didn't you?
%
Wow! I wasn't sure if you'd make it...
%
Sorry, forgot to introduce myself.
%
Just letting you know that I'll be monitoring your performance from here on out.
%
Next time you'll surely tear 'em down!
%
...What. The grades can go this low?
%
...
...
...
...
...
...
Do you think this is a joke?
%
Please, don't waste our time like this.
%
Being the pilot of the weakest fighter is a rather thankless job after all.
%
But as you know, only people of a certain bloodline are able to control the fighters.
%
You're the only one who can use Type-C.
%
How Type-B chose such an airhead as its pilot, we may never know...
%
Orange must have fallen pretty far from the tree with you two.
%
You're nothing like your big sister.
%
Remember, you only get to pilot the fighter because we allow it...
%
Remember, one Type-A is better than Type-B and Type-C put together...
Hmm? That didn't sound very encouraging.
Good.
%
If only you'd stop messing around and acted more seriously like your sisters.
%
Hmm? You think you could beat "Grapefruit" in a fight?
%
Just a couple more shots and you'll ace it!
%
We guess it's great that you're finally starting to live up to our minimal expectations...
%
Our goofball has her pros, it seems.
%
Only Renji has achieved this grade before...

A supercomputer wouldn't lose to a klutz such as you.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION

PLEASE REMAIN STATIONARY

SHUTTING DOWN........ GOODBYE
PLEASE LEAVE. LEAVE.

THERE'S NO REASON TO CONTINUE

THERE IS NOTHING BUT DESPAIR
DOWN THIS PATH.

PLEASE UNDERSTAND...
I CANNOT ALLOW YOU
TO SEE BEYOND THIS POINT.

IN THAT CASE, MAY YOU ATTAIN:

IF IT CANNOT BE HELPED...
I'LL MAKE YOU LEAVE
IN MY OWN WAY.

%
HAVE YOU NOT HAD
MORE THAN ENOUGH PRACTICE?
%
BEFORE YOU GO, THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED TO TELL YOU--
%
Even so, I'm willing to bet everything on that chance.
%
A great power has emerged within you.
%
I hope you carry this power with you, wherever you may end up.
%
I'm a little bit afraid.
%
Do you think...
This new future...
Your future.
%
If we were to be born again in it... Would it accept us?
%
Whether you succeed or not, now solely depends on your resolve.
%
Their new god would set out towards the endless sky... and devour it.
%
Manusya were unable to simply admire this flower.
They wanted it for themselves.
%
At the beginning, a flower gave bloom, filling the space with stars.
We, manusya, were given form along with other beings.
Together we basked in the light of the flower.
We called it the Lotus Jewel.
%
If only our ancestors had foreseen the despair
this task would awaken in their creation...
%
Those husks of yours that you call fighters...
Your power is one and the same.

Full of hopes, dreams, and love.

Listen up, kiddo. Don't make the same mistake I did. Remember to treasure what's important to you.

Oh my...
What an embarrassment this is.

If the master sees you alive
that would be very bad
for both of us.
%
Do not worry.
I devised a way to
bypass this problem
without anyone getting harmed.
%
Can't I even rest in peace...?
%
Foolish warriors of Manusya.
%
After all I've done to help you...
This is your response?
%
Such arrogance will only be met
with death.
%
A peaceful death... finally.
%
I, too, fought your usurper a long time ago.
%
Alas now I'm nothing more than a prisoner...
Kept alive out of spite.
%
...This peculiar air of yours... it
can't be mistaken.
%
HA.
HA HA.
You are foolish indeed.
%
Maybe this old fool can offer you some wisdom.
%
Warriors of manusya, listen carefully.
%
This is the story of a god who wanted to become...

This is the story of a fighter who wanted to become...

%
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO THIS AGAIN.
%
DO YOU THINK SHE STILL REMEMBERS?
%
SINCE THE GREAT CATASTROPHE,
HUMANS WERE AFRAID OF THE STARS.
EVEN AFTER CONQUERING THEIR FEARS,
THE 2ND APOCALYPSE HAD ONCE AGAIN
SHOWN THE WRATH OF THE STARS.

NOW AT THE EVE OF DESTRUCTION
THE ROAD TOWARDS THE NEST OF EVIL
HAD BEEN OPENED ONCE MORE.

THE FIGHTERS GAZED AT THE MASSIVE
HELLSTAR KNOWN AS GREEN ORANGE,
FATIGUED BY THE ENDLESS ORDEALS
IT HAD THROWN AT THEM BY DEFYING
THE LAWS OF TIME AND SPACE.

THEY WONDERED HOW MUCH LONGER
THEY WOULD BE ENTRAPPED
BY THIS BEAUTIFUL SPACE AROUND THEM.
WASN'T THERE ANY WAY TO
BREAK THROUGH THIS VICIOUS CYCLE?

ALTHOUGH THEY COULDN'T SEE IT,
SOMETHING WAS MISSING.
AS IF THEY HAD LOST
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT. 
%
Once again, you've returned.
%
Despite all the hardships.
Despite your non-existent chances.
Despite everything.
You refuse to give up?
%
There's no reason to continue
this arduous battle
for any longer.
%
In fact,
I regret everything
I've done to you.
%
I feel the best thing 
I could do is
to end it all
and leave forever.

%
I've no business with errand boys!
%
I'm still mad at you.

%
I'm sorry that I have brought trouble upon you all.
%
I guess the ghosts of the past are no longer needed here.
%
You are a part of us. Always.
%
...And now I'm getting a pep talk from my little sisters.
Maybe this world has some hope left after all.
%
Now go. You'll know what to do.

TOWARDS THE BRIGHTER FUTURE!
