SINCE THE GREAT CATASTROPHE,

EVEN AFTER CONQUERING THEIR FEARS,
THE 2ND APOCALYPSE HAD ONCE AGAIN
SHOWN THE WRATH OF THE STARS.

NOW AT THE EVE OF DESTRUCTION
THE ROAD TOWARDS THE NEST OF EVIL
HAD BEEN OPENED ONCE MORE.

THE FIGHTERS GAZED AT THE MASSIVE
HELLSTAR KNOWN AS GREEN ORANGE,
FATIGUED BY THE ENDLESS ORDEALS
IT HAD THROWN AT THEM BY DEFYING
THE LAWS OF TIME AND SPACE.

THEY WONDERED HOW MUCH LONGER
THEY WOULD BE ENTRAPPED
BY THIS BEAUTIFUL SPACE AROUND THEM.
WASN'T THERE ANY WAY TO
BREAK THROUGH THIS VICIOUS CYCLE?

ALTHOUGH THEY COULDN'T SEE IT,
SOMETHING WAS MISSING.
AS IF THEY HAD LOST
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT. 
%
Once again, you've returned.
%
Despite all the hardships.
Despite your non-existent chances.
Despite everything.
You refuse to give up?
%
There's no reason to continue
this arduous battle
for any longer.
%
In fact,
I regret everything
I've done to you.
%
I feel the best thing 
I could do is
to end it all
and leave forever.

%
I hope this won't hurt too much...?
%
I'm done playing charades with you, Green Orange.
%
I've no business with errand boys!
%
I'm still mad at you.
%
PERISH, FOOLISH DAIKONS!
%
I'm sorry that I have brought trouble upon you all.
%
I guess the ghosts of the past are no longer needed here.
%
You are a part of us. Always.
%
...And now I'm getting a pep talk from my little sisters.
Maybe this world has some hope left after all.
%
Now go. You'll know what to do.
%
TOWARDS THE BRIGHTER FUTURE!
